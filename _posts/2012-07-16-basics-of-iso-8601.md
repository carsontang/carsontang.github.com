When downloading Facebook feed data in JSON, I encountered dates written
likes this: `2012-07-06T07:54:56+0000`. This format is specified by ISO 8601. ISO 8601 is a standard that provides an unambiguous representation of dates and times.
Basically, it represents `07:54:56 am July 6, 2012 GMT` (Greenwich Mean Time).

California, during the summer, is in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT), which is
7 hours before GMT. When daylight savings is over, California is in
Pacific Standard Time (PST), which is 8 hours before GMT.

Thus, `2012-07-06T07:54:56+0000` in California was `12:54:56 am, July 6, 2012`.
